# proof-of-work-solver

The aim of this project is to create a program that interacts with other programs over a network (socket programming), and multi-threaded applications. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, a server-based proof-of-work solver for the Hashcash mining algorithm used in Bitcoin. The functions are implemented in the Simple Stratum Text Protocol (SSTP), which is used to format messages between clients and server program.
